## üé® Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

```typescript
/**
 * Loads NFT collectors for a specific token
 * @param contract - The NFT contract address
 * @param tokenId - The token ID to fetch collectors for
 * @returns Array of collector addresses
 */
async function loadCollectors(contract: string, tokenId: string): Promise<string[]> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and small
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props

```typescript
interface NFTCardProps {
  nft: NFTData;
  onExpand?: () => void;
  className?: string;
}

export function NFTCard({ nft, onExpand, className }: NFTCardProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure responsive design
- Test on different screen sizes

## üß™ Testing

- Different wallet addresses
- Various NFT collections
- Different screen sizes
- Both 3D and 2D modes
- All interactive features
